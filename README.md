# ilp-cw-Drone-Coin-Collection
**Course:**
Informatics Large Practical 

**Objective:** 
Given a PowerGrab map with pre-existing stations, a drone will have to find a path that collects as many coins from as many positive 
stations as possible. The stateless drone has a limited look-ahead constraint and decides the next direction randomly. The stateful drone 
can observe the whole map to choose the closest positive station and head towards it. Both drones aim to avoid negative-charged stations. 

**Language:** Java

**Files:**
1) ilp-report.pdf : class documentation and detailed strategy implemented
2) powergrab : relevant source files that executes the drones' flight paths
3) ilp-results : folder containing screenshots (.geojson files) of the 2 drones' flightpaths varying in days and year, and the corresponding coins
   collected by the drones (in .txt files).
